# Predictive-Analysis-of-COVID-19-Hospitalizations-in-Los-Angeles-County

1) Merged and sanitized datasets from diverse sources, including LA County's historical hospitalization records, COVID-19 epidemiological data, vaccination progression, and significant public holidays.

2) Utilized supervised dimension reduction techniques, leveraging linear regression, decision trees, and random forests to refine the dataset, enhancing its suitability for predictive analytics.

3) Designed and calibrated three predictive algorithms â€” Linear Regression, Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs), and Decision Trees. Identified the MLP model as the top performer while ensuring tight performance benchmarks across all models.

4) Successfully forecasted a two-week hospitalization trajectory with a high degree of accuracy, underscoring the importance of meticulous data preprocessing and the effective structure of datasets.

5) Exhibited proficiency in a range of data processes, from initial cleaning and integration to sophisticated transformation, laying the groundwork for actionable, data-driven insights in a high-stakes healthcare context.
